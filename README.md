# Smart-Parking-Assistant-Project-ParCar-
Developed a system for precise car positioning in a garage using distance measurement and visual indicators. The  system signals correct positioning and deactivates lights after inactivity.

ParCar! is an automatic system designed to assist drivers in parking vehicles precisely in narrow garages. It uses a distance sensor to detect the car's position and provides visual cues through LED color changes. Green indicates a long distance, yellow indicates a medium distance, and red indicates a short (ideal) distance. If the car remains at the short distance for 10 seconds, the red LED will automatically turn off. This system ensures accurate and efficient parking by reducing the need for manual interaction from the driver. It is equipped with a switch to save energy when not in use, ParCar! enhances convenience and efficiency in vehicle parking.
